Some of the awesome sauce we use to run super quick queries against twitter

## Twitter Follows
Since the release of the version 5 of the [twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) you can now run a query for 200 followers against twitter as apposed to the old version of just 20.

Within the twitter_followers.rb file we demonstrate how to do this quickly and efficiently.
